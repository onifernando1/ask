This is my first project using node, mongoose and express

New skills I learned:
Express
Mongoose
Mongodb
Pug
Node
Using pug everything syntax
Creating navbar and reusables components pug
Accessing and using database
Using middleware
Using passport.js

Goals:

I only wanted to use pure CSS, no boostrap etc, to refine my skills and get some more practice - why use bootstrap when I can do it myself?

I wanted to play around with some different designs.

This was a challenge as it is my first proper node js project, learning how to use node, models, controllers, mongoose, Mongo database and also I was learning pug for the first time. Having created some projects using ruby and rails, I felt like this helped me to understand the backend stuff a lot more quickly.

Issues:
Middleware in wrong order
Res.locals.currentUser
Accessing user var from pug

I started to design it like askfm, but then I decided against it, and wanted to make it more like a more popular social media platform, and started trying to recreate twitter or facebook, but I found them too boring. Then I found this cool design at https://stickers.evrone.com/3/ - telegram stickers for developers. I really liked the idea of having a phone on the page and wanted to incorporate that.
